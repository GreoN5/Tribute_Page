                <p>Robert Nesta Marley was born on 6 February 1945 at the farm of his maternal grandfather in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish,
                Jamaica, to Norval Sinclair Marley and Cedella Malcolm. Norval Marley was a white Jamaican from Clarendon Parish,
                Jamaica, whose family claimed to have Syrian Jewish origins. Norval claimed to have been a captain in
                the Royal Marines; at the time of his marriage to Cedella Malcolm, an Afro-Jamaican then 18 years old, he was
                employed as a plantation overseer. Bob Marley's full name is Robert Nesta Marley, though some sources give his
                birth name as Nesta Robert Marley, with a story that when Marley was still a boy a Jamaican passport official reversed
                his first and middle names because Nesta sounded like a girl's name. Norval provided financial support for his
                wife and child but seldom saw them as he was often away. Bob Marley attended Stepney Primary and Junior High School
                which serves the catchment area of Saint Ann. In 1955, when Bob Marley was 10 years old, his father died of a
                heart attack at the age of 70. Marley's mother went on later to marry Edward Booker, a civil servant from the United
                States, giving Marley two half-brothers: Richard and Anthony.</p>

                <p>Bob Marley and Neville Livingston (later known as Bunny Wailer) had been childhood friends in Nine Mile. They had
                started to play music together while at Stepney Primary and Junior High School. Marley left Nine Mile with his
                mother when he was 12 and moved to Trenchtown, Kingston. She and Thadeus Livingston (Bunny Wailer's father) had a
                daughter together whom they named Claudette Pearl, who was a younger sister to both Bob and Bunny. Now that Marley
                and Livingston were living together in the same house in Trenchtown, their musical explorations deepened to include the
                latest R&B from United States radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica, and the new ska music. </p>

                    The move to
                    Trenchtown was proving to be fortuitous, and Marley soon found himself in a vocal group with Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh,
                    Beverley Kelso and Junior Braithwaite. Joe Higgs, who was part of the successful vocal act Higgs and Wilson, resided on
                    3rd St., and his singing partner Roy Wilson had been raised by the grandmother of Junior Braithwaite. Higgs and Wilson
                    would rehearse at the back of the houses between 2nd and 3rd Streets, and soon, Marley (now residing on 2nd St.), Junior
                    Braithwaite and the others were congregating around this successful duo. Marley and the others did not play any
                    instruments at this time, and were more interested in being a vocal harmony group. Higgs was glad to help them develop
                    their vocal harmonies, although more importantly, he had started to teach Marley how to play guitar—thereby creating the
                    bedrock that would later allow Marley to construct some of the biggest-selling reggae songs in the history of the
                    genre.
