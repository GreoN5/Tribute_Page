                    In July 1977, Marley was found to have a type of malignant melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend,
                    this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year but was instead a symptom of
                    already-existing cancer. He had to see two doctors before a biopsy was made, which confirmed the deadliest kind of skin
                    cancer: acral lentiginous melanoma. Unlike other melanomas, usually on skin exposed to the sun, acral lentiginous
                    melanoma occurs in places that are easy to miss, such as the soles of the feet, or under toenails. Although it is the
                    commonest melanoma in people with dark skin, it is not widely recognised, and was not mentioned in the most popular
                    medical textbook of the time.
                    <br><br>
                    Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career),
                    citing his religious beliefs, and instead, the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft was taken from his thigh
                    to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and was in the process of scheduling a world tour
                    in 1980.
                    <br><br>
                    The album Uprising was released in May 1980. The band completed a major tour of Europe, where it played its biggest
                    concert to 100,000 people in Milan, Italy. After the tour Marley went to the United States, where he performed two shows
                    at Madison Square Garden in New York City as part of the Uprising Tour. He collapsed while jogging in Central Park
                    and was taken to hospital, where it was found that his cancer had spread to his brain, lungs, and liver.
                    <br><br>
                    Marley's last concert took place two days later at the Stanley Theater (now The Benedum Center For The Performing Arts)
                    in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 23 September 1980.
                    <br><br>
                    The only known photographs from the show were included in Kevin Macdonald's documentary film Marley.
                    <br><br>
                    Shortly afterward, Marley's health deteriorated as his cancer had spread throughout his body. The rest of the tour was
                    canceled and Marley sought treatment at the clinic of Josef Issels in Bavaria, Germany, where he underwent an
                    alternative cancer treatment called Issels treatment partly based on avoidance of certain foods, drinks, and other
                    substances. After eight months of effectively failing to treat his advancing cancer, Marley boarded a plane for his home
                    in Jamaica. During the flight Marley's vital functions worsened. After landing in Miami, Florida, he was taken to
                    Cedars of Lebanon Hospital (later University of Miami Hospital) for immediate medical attention, but died on 11 May
                    1981, aged 36, due to the spread of melanoma to his lungs and brain. His final words to his son Ziggy were "Money can't
                    buy life."
                    <br><br>
                    Marley was given a state funeral in Jamaica on 21 May 1981, which combined elements of Ethiopian Orthodoxy and
                    Rastafari tradition. He was buried in a chapel near his birthplace with his guitar.
                    <br><br>
                    On 21 May 1981, Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga delivered the final funeral eulogy to Marley, saying:
                    <br>
                    "His voice was an omnipresent cry in our electronic world. His sharp features, majestic looks, and prancing style a vivid
                    etching on the landscape of our minds. Bob Marley was never seen. He was an experience which left an indelible imprint
                    with each encounter. Such a man cannot be erased from the mind. He is part of the collective consciousness of the
                    nation."
