                <p>Robert Nesta Marley, OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and musician. Considered one
                of the pioneers of reggae, his musical career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as
                his distinctive vocal and songwriting style. Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican
                music worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture for over a decade. Over the course of his career
                Marley became known as a Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality. He is also considered
                a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for the
                legalization of marijuana, while he also advocated for Pan-Africanism.</p>

                <p>Born in Nine Mile, British Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963,
                after forming Bob Marley and
                the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which contained the single "One
                Love/People Get Ready"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae. The
                Wailers subsequently released eleven further studio albums; while initially employing louder instrumentation and
                singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which
                coincided
                with the singer's conversion to Rastafarianism. During this period Marley relocated to London, and the group
                typified
                their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers (1971).</p>
