                    A statue was inaugurated, next to the national stadium on Arthur Wint Drive in Kingston to commemorate him. In 2006,
                    the New York City Department of Education co-named a portion of Church Avenue from Remsen Avenue to East 98th Street in
                    the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn as "Bob Marley Boulevard". In 2008, a statue of Marley was inaugurated in
                    Banatski Sokolac, Serbia.
                    <br><br>
                    Internationally, Marley's message also continues to reverberate among various indigenous communities. For instance, the
                    Australian Aboriginal people continue to burn a sacred flame to honour his memory in Sydney's Victoria Park, while
                    members of the Native American Hopi and Havasupai tribes revere his work. There are also many tributes to Bob
                    Marley throughout India, including restaurants, hotels, and cultural festivals.
                    <br><br>
                    Marley evolved into a global symbol, which has been endlessly merchandised through a variety of mediums. In light of
                    this, author Dave Thompson in his book Reggae and Caribbean Music, laments what he perceives to be the commercialised
                    pacification of Marley's more militant edge, stating:
                    "Bob Marley ranks among both the most popular and the most misunderstood figures in modern culture ... That the machine
                    has utterly emasculated Marley is beyond doubt. Gone from the public record is the ghetto kid who dreamed of Che Guevara
                    and the Black Panthers, and pinned their posters up in the Wailers Soul Shack record store; who believed in freedom; and
                    the fighting which it necessitated, and dressed the part on an early album sleeve; whose heroes were James Brown and
                    Muhammad Ali; whose God was Ras Tafari and whose sacrament was marijuana. Instead, the Bob Marley who surveys his
                    kingdom today is smiling benevolence, a shining sun, a waving palm tree, and a string of hits which tumble out of polite
                    radio like candy from a gumball machine. Of course it has assured his immortality. But it has also demeaned him beyond
                    recognition. Bob Marley was worth far more."
                    <br><br>
                    Several film adaptations have evolved as well. For instance, a feature-length documentary about his life, Rebel Music,
                    won various awards at the Grammys. With contributions from Rita, The Wailers, and Marley's lovers and children, it also
                    tells much of the story in his own words. In February 2008, director Martin Scorsese announced his intention to
                    produce a documentary movie on Marley. The film was set to be released on 6 February 2010, on what would have been
                    Marley's 65th birthday. However, Scorsese dropped out due to scheduling problems. He was replaced by Jonathan
                    Demme, who dropped out due to creative differences with producer Steve Bing during the beginning of editing. Kevin
                    Macdonald replaced Demme and the film, Marley, was released on 20 April 2012. In 2011, ex-girlfriend and
                    filmmaker Esther Anderson, along with Gian Godoy, made the documentary Bob Marley: The Making of a Legend, which
                    premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.
                    <br><br>
                    In October 2015, Jamaican author Marlon James' novel A Brief History of Seven Killings, a fictional account of the
                    attempted assassination of Marley, won the 2015 Man Booker Prize at a ceremony in London.
                    <br><br>
                    In February 2020, the musical Get Up Stand Up!, the Bob Marley Story was announced by writer Lee Hall and director
                    Dominic Cooke, starring Arinzé Kene as Bob Marley. It will open at London's Lyric Theatre in February 2021.
